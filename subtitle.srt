00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Shortest job first

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,608
Mr face that

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
What does it means

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,568
Whenever you choose any process you are going to do anything completion otherwise you are not going to stop

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
How to how to do this

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
1st year

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
First I am going to use

80

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,768
Arrival time is minimum is not there for no process I should ever 880

24
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304
21 so

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,912
The first person which will be available will be at time one therefore from zero to one

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
Time one leave only for seven days EP 1

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:21,408
I am going to take P1 and run it in computer and it is non preemptive version right

28
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,760
How much time does it take for me to complete 7 minutes 21788

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808

Cp1 is over

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,856
Dekho Delhi Terminal T3 which is having the best time of one paper and take fees in next

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,488
Bus time of wonderful is going to be running till 9

40
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Now

41
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
P3 is over then what is the next one with the least bus stand

42
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Wishes to

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Jaipur

44
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
4

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,824
Which is having a bus time of to there for the completion time is 11

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
Hello everyone is to another is 5

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
I have two forces

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
134 134 have 2 and 5

49
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
These two which one is having the least bus time

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
We want it

51
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Delhi bus time is it

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
I am go to take P2

53
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,888
And we whose bus time is 5 then 4 11 + 56

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,752
Nokia 3 only one is remaining and it is already available at 16

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
FIFA which is it

56
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
416 + 8 is how much

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
24

58
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
Shortest shortest job first

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Germany job

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
The question might be

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
Give any random combination of process with random

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Possible arrival time

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
Our shortest job

64
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Will always scheduling shortest job first

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
It is false

66
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Study schedule on the available for psus the shortest job first which means that you are looking outstanding

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
Time one at this point of time one

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Only for special level C1

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,808
That is not used but it doesn't mean that even is a shortage of right

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,184
Jaipur shortage of works in such a way that among available for certificate to take the shortest job

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Guarantee that

72
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,304
Whatever you want I am always with you start with the list of first

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Therefore in this case

74
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
It is 7

75
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
What happens in sometime

76
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Heroine

77
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
Shortest job first will also fall fall victim to conversate Ameen

78
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,408
Not mention

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,064
The longest process between the process with the highest bus time watches bus time

80
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
Computer

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,768
Yes you are going for this one right there for shortest job first is also

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Is it team of

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Save this example

84
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,543
I think you understood this forget finish it off then I'll show you what is a problem with this is there

85
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
Shortest job first and then we can continue the next America

86
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
Write this page

87
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,671
What is the data structure which supports is algorithm

88
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Got it

89
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
Among all the available processes

90
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
I might have to pick the

91
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
List one which means the one with the least bus time

92
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
For the min heap is suitable data structure for this

93
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
You can find the minimum

94
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,151
Delete delete delete it unit against basic advice

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
Tarzan

96
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,111
Maintain maintain the Bean property based on the bus stand

97
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
Deccan always root is going to the process with the

98
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Nice bus time

99
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
And you are always going to remove it

100
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Schedule

101
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
And so it out

102
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
What is the min heap is the best best data structure

103
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
This one

104
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Every

105
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,127
One process will be added exactly once and exactly once

106
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
Therefore for every forces edition in one division

107
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
Condition is going to take login time adding element in the min heap

108
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
Admission is going to take login time right

109
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,951
Then into 2 interlocking therefore and login is the time complexity for this

110
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,583
Hi please refer to the algorithm in high point and come back and watch it

111
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
You didn't understand what I am saying you please go to algorithms what you can come back

112
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Sexy about the complete and time

113
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
When did 1 complete

114
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
P1 completed at 8:00

115
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
And P2 completed 16

116
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Petri completed at 9:00

117
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
P4 completed at 11:00

118
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
FIFA completed 24

119
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
After that we can find on the turnaround time

120
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
What is the timer on time

121
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
I told you that transfer on time is

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,447
Completion time - arrival time difference of these two

123
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
Then what is it

124
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
7 year

125
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
14 year

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
And it is 6 year

127
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Editors

128
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
2nd year

129
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
And it is the

130
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
19 year

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
Is it on time

132
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Xx

133
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,255
So what is waiting time I told you that waiting time is turnaround time - bus time

134
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,095
You can do all this very easily with this simple trick will think

135
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
I am doing it you can do it do it yourself

136
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Not able to adjust

137
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
14 - 59

138
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
My son is 5

139
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
NDTV Lagan

140
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Nothing like this

141
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,415
What is the average turnaround time and what is the average waiting time

142
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
So here also should be careful

143
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,399
That when you are standing at any point just see what are the process available don't directly go and pick up the Lost no

144
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Bus stand

145
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
Also examples

146
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
This also

147
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Manilal standard
